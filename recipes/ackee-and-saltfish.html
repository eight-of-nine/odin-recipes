    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            First, prepare your saltfish by either soaking it in water overnight, draining it, and then boiling it once,
            and then draining it again. You can also skip the overnight soak and boil and drain the salted fish 2-3
            times until the excess salt is removed. Once the saltfish has been boiled and drained, break the saltfish
            into small pieces. Set aside.
        </li>

            Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions, scallions, thyme, and scotch bonnet to skillet and
            saut√© for 3-4 minutes, until onions have softened. Add salted fish and stir for an additional minute.
