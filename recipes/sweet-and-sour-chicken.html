        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>Minced ginger</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan until very hot. (5 tbsp vegetable oil)
        </li>

        <li>
            Whilst the oil is heating, place the egg in one shallow bowl and the cornflour in another shallow bowl. Add
            the flour, salt, pepper, garlic salt and paprika to another shallow bowl and mix together. (2 eggs lightly
            beaten,3 tbsp cornflour (cornstarch),90 g (3/4 cup) plain flour (all-purpose flour),½ tsp salt,½ tsp
            pepper,½ tsp garlic salt,2 tsp paprika)
        </li>

        <li>
            Dredge the chicken in the cornflour, then dip it in the egg (make sure all of the chicken is covered in egg
            wash), and finally dredge it in the seasoned flour. Repeat until you've coated all the chicken. (3 skinless
            chicken breast fillets)
        </li>


        <li>
            Add to the wok and cook on a high heat for 6-7 minutes, turning two or three times during cooking, until
            well browned. You may need to cook in two batches (I find I can do it in one batch so long as it's no more
            than 3 chicken breasts).
        </li>

        <li>
            Check the chicken is cooked (see notes) and remove from the pan and place in a bowl lined with kitchen
            towels.
        </li>


        <li>
            Whilst the chicken is cooking, you can start on your sauce.
        </li>


        <li>
            Add the oil to a large frying pan/skillet, heat it up on a medium-to-high heat and add in the onions and the
            peppers . Cook for 3 minutes, stirring every now and then, until the onions start to go translucent. (1 tbsp
            vegetable oil,1 large onion,1 red pepper,1 green pepper)
        </li>


        <li>
            Add in the garlic and ginger and cook for another minute. (2 cloves of garlic,1 tsp minced ginger)
        </li>


        <li>
            Add the tomato ketchup, vinegar, dark brown sugar, and the tinned pineapple (including the juice) and stir.
            Bring to the boil, and then turn down the heat and let it bubble, stirring every so often, until slightly
            thickened, should take 3-5 minutes. (150 ml (2/3 cup) tomato ketchup,2 tbsp malt vinegar,6 tbsp dark brown
            muscovado sugar,475 g (17 oz) canned pineapple chunks in juice)
        </li>


        <li>
            Transfer the cooked crispy chicken to the pan with the sauce and gently toss to coat.
        </li>


        <li>
            Serve with boiled or fried rice and a sprinkling of sesame seeds.
            (egg fried rice or boiled rice,1 tsp sesame seeds)
        </li>
    </ol>
